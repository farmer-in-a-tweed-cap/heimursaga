										Test Heimursaga (HEY-mer-saga) is a text-focused, map-centric social media platform and online travel journal for explorers and travelers. Heimursaga's core feature is the ability for users
										to read and write journal entries tagged to precise geographic coordinates. Features currently in development include trip planning, route lines and entry grouping, private messaging, 
										and user fundraising capability. The name "Heimursaga" is derived from the Old Norse words "heimr" meaning "world", and "saga" meaning "story". <!--The Heimursaga web application was developed in Colorado and is funded and managed by The Peripety Company.--> <br><br>
